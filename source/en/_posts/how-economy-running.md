[](#Interest-in-Economy)Interest in Economy
I originally had no interest in paying attention to things related to economics. During school days, liked more to talk about national affairs, always fantasizing about swords and traveling the world, how to accomplish some earth-shattering, unprecedented great undertaking, following current events everywhere. To this day not being fooled lame, is really something to celebrate.
Today let me understand how the economic machine runs. Because I've started becoming interested in investment, making money, and economic operating laws.
This is what I saw in a video. Not necessarily correct, judge for yourself. I'll record what the video said, then ponder it myself.
Let's begin.

[](#Economic-Machine)Economic Machine
The economy runs like a simple machine. But many people don't quite understand this, or have different views on how the economy runs, thus leading to many unnecessary economic losses.
Although the economy looks complex, it actually runs in a simple and mechanical way. The economy consists of several simple parts and countless repeated simple transactions. These transactions are first driven by human nature, thus forming three main economic forces.

First, improved productivity,
Second, short-term debt cycle,
Third, long-term debt cycle.

[](#Transactions)Transactions
The economy is nothing more than the sum of countless transactions, and a transaction is a very simple thing. Transactions happen all the time. Every time we buy something, we're making a transaction. In each transaction, the buyer uses money or credit to exchange with the seller for goods, services, or financial assets. **Credit** is used just like money when used, so adding money spent and credit together gives total expenditure. Total expenditure is the driving force of the economy. If you divide expenditure amount by sales volume, you get price. It's that simple, this is a transaction. **Transaction** is the most basic part of the economic machine. All economic cycles and forces are caused by transactions. So understanding transactions is necessary to understand the entire economy.

A market consists of all buyers and sellers buying and selling the same commodity. For example, wheat market, car market, stock market, and thousands of other markets. The economy is composed of all transactions in all markets. Adding total expenditure and sales volume in all markets gives all the information needed to understand how the economy runs. Individuals, businesses, banks, and governments all engage in transactions in the above manner, using money and credit to exchange for goods, services, and financial assets. Government is the largest buyer and seller, and government has two components: the central government that collects taxes and the central bank that spends money. The central bank controls the amount of money and credit in the economy, so it's different from other buyers and sellers. The central bank exercises this control by influencing interest rates and issuing more money. Therefore, the central bank plays an important role in credit circulation.

[](#Credit)Credit
**Credit** is the most important part of the economy, but perhaps the most misunderstood part. It's most important because it's the largest and most unpredictable part of the economy. Lenders and borrowers are no different from buyers and sellers trading in a market. Usually, lenders hope their money can earn more money, while borrowers want to buy something they can't currently afford. Like a house, a car, or making an investment, such as starting a business. Lending can meet the needs of both lenders and borrowers. The borrower promises to repay the loan, called principal, and pay an additional amount, called interest. **When interest rates are high, borrowing decreases because loans become expensive; when interest rates are low, borrowing increases because loans become cheap**. If the borrower promises to repay the debt, and the lender believes this promise, credit is created. Any two people can create credit out of thin air by agreement! Credit seems simple, actually complex, because credit has other names. Once credit is created, it immediately becomes **debt**. Debt is the lender's asset, the borrower's liability. When the borrower later repays the loan and pays interest, these assets and liabilities disappear, and the transaction is completed. So why is credit so important?

This is because, once the borrower gets credit, they can increase their spending. Don't forget, spending is the driving force of the economy, because **one person's spending is another person's income**. Think about it, every dollar you spend, someone else earns a dollar; and every dollar you earn, someone else must have spent a dollar. So the more you spend, the more others earn. If someone's income increases, their creditworthiness increases, and lenders are more willing to lend money to them. People with good credit have two conditions: **repayment ability** and **collateral**. High income-to-debt ratio, the borrower has repayment ability. If unable to repay, the borrower can also use valuable, sellable assets as collateral. This way, lenders can confidently lend money to them. So, increased income leads to increased borrowing, which can increase spending. Since one person's spending is another's income, this leads to further increased borrowing, and continues cycling. This self-driving pattern leads to economic growth, and it's precisely because of this that economic cycles are produced.

In a transaction, to get something you must give up something else. In the long run, how much you get depends on how much you produce. Our knowledge gradually increases over time, the accumulation of knowledge will improve our standard of living, we call this **improved productivity**. An innovative and hardworking person will improve productivity and standard of living faster than those complacent and lazy people. But in the short term it doesn't necessarily show. Productivity is most critical in the long run, but credit is most important in the short term. This is because productivity improvements don't fluctuate dramatically, so it's not an important driving force for economic ups and downs. But debt is this driving force, because we can consume through borrowing beyond expenditure, but when repaying debt must consume below expenditure. Debt fluctuations have two major cycles, one lasts about 5 to 8 years, the other lasts about 75 to 100 years. Most people can feel the fluctuations, but because they're too close to the fluctuations, every day, every week they're in it, usually don't think of it as a cycle.

As mentioned above, **economic ups and downs don't depend on how good people are at innovating or working hard, but mainly on the amount of credit**. Let's first imagine an economy without credit. In such an economy, the only way to increase spending is to increase income, thus needing to improve productivity and workload. Improving productivity and economic growth is the only way. Since my spending is another person's income, when my or another person's productivity improves, the economy grows. If we observe various transactions and summarize them, we'll find an asymptote similar to productivity growth trajectory. But, because we borrow, cycles are produced, not because of any laws, but because of human nature and how credit works. **Borrowing is just consuming in advance**, to buy something you can't afford now, your spending must exceed your income. Therefore, you need to borrow money, essentially borrowing from your future self. You set a future time for yourself, at that time, your spending must be less than your income to repay the debt. This immediately forms a cycle. Usually once you borrow, you create a cycle, same for individuals as for the entire economy. This is why you must understand credit, because **credit triggers a series of mechanical and predictable events that will happen in the future, this is where credit differs from money**. Completing transactions requires money. When you use cash to buy a beer in a bar, the transaction is completed immediately. But if you use credit to buy a beer, like on credit, you're essentially promising to pay for that beer later. You and the bar together created an asset and a debt. You created credit out of thin air. Only when you later pay off this credit will the above asset and liability disappear, the debt be cleared, and the transaction be concluded.

In real life, most so-called money is actually credit. Don't forget, **in an economy without credit, the only way to increase spending is to improve production**. But in an economy with credit, you can also increase spending through borrowing. Therefore, an economy with credit can increase spending, making income growth exceed productivity growth in the short term, but not in the long term. **But credit is not necessarily bad**, just leads to cyclical changes. If credit causes excessive consumption beyond repayment ability, it's bad credit. But if credit efficiently allocates resources and generates income letting you repay debt, it's good credit. For example, if you borrow money to buy a big color TV, the TV won't bring any income to repay the debt. But if you borrow money to buy a tractor, use it to harvest more crops, earn more money you can repay the debt and improve standard of living. In an economy with credit, we can track various transactions and observe how credit brings economic growth.

For example: suppose you earn $100,000 a year, have no debt. You have good credit, can borrow $10,000, like using a credit card. So, you can spend $110,000 a year, even though your income is only $100,000. Since your spending is others' income, someone else therefore earns $110,000. If this person earning $110,000 has no debt, can borrow $11,000. They can spend $121,000, even though their annual income is only $110,000. Since their spending is another person's income, and we track various transactions, we can see this process continuously reinforcing itself. But don't forget, **borrowing forms cycles**, cycles will rise, and eventually will fall.

[](#Short-Term-Debt-Cycle)Short-Term Debt Cycle
Now let's talk about the short-term debt cycle. As economic activity increases, expansion appears, this is the first stage of the short-term debt cycle. Spending continues to increase, prices start to rise. Reason: what increases spending is credit, and credit can be immediately created out of thin air. If **spending and income growth exceeds production speed of goods sold, prices will rise**. We call this price rise **inflation**.

The central bank doesn't want inflation too high, because this causes many problems. When the central bank sees prices rising, it will raise interest rates. As interest rates rise, people able to borrow decrease, while existing debt costs also rise, equal to your monthly credit card repayment increasing. Because people reduce borrowing, repayment amounts increase, remaining funds for spending decrease, so spending slows down. And since one person's spending is another's income, linked together, people's income will decline. Because spending decreases, prices will fall, we call this **deflation**. Economic activity decreases, economy enters recession. If recession is too severe, and inflation is no longer a problem, the central bank will lower interest rates to re-accelerate economic activity. As interest rates decrease, repayment costs decrease, borrowing and spending increase, appearing another economic expansion.

Visible, the economy runs like a machine. **In the short-term debt cycle, the only factor limiting spending is the willingness of lenders and borrowers to lend and borrow**. If credit is easy to get, the economy expands. If credit is hard to get, the economy recedes. Note, this cycle is mainly controlled by the central bank. The short-term debt cycle usually lasts 5-8 years, continuously repeating over decades. But note, after each cycle's low and high, economic growth and debt exceed the previous cycle. Why is this? It's caused by people. People have a tendency to borrow more money and spend more money, and don't like repaying debt, this is human nature. Therefore, in the long term, debt increases faster than income, thus forming a long-term debt cycle.

Although people's debt increases, lenders provide looser credit conditions, why is this? This is because, everyone thinks the situation is great! People only pay attention to recent situations. What's the recent situation? Income keeps increasing! Asset values keep rising! Stock market is booming! It's prosperity! Using borrowed money to buy goods, services, and financial assets is very cost-effective. When people excessively borrow and consume, **bubbles** are produced. Therefore, although debt keeps increasing. But income also increases at a similar rate, thus offsetting debt. We call the debt-to-income ratio the **debt burden**, as long as income continues rising, the debt burden is bearable. At the same time, asset values rise rapidly, people borrow heavily to buy assets, because investment drives asset prices higher daily. People feel wealthy. Therefore, although accumulated large debt, rising income and asset values help borrowers maintain good creditworthiness over the long term. But this situation obviously can't continue permanently, and indeed didn't continue. At a certain time, repayment cost increase speed exceeds income, forcing people to cut spending.

Because one person's spending is another's income, income starts to decline. People's credit therefore decreases, causing borrowing to decrease. Repayment costs continue to increase, causing further spending reduction, the cycle starts to reverse. Now reached the peak of long-term debt, debt burden becomes too heavy. The US, Europe, and many other regions in the world experienced this in 2008, Japan in 1989 and the US in 1929 experienced this for the same reason. Now the economy enters the deleveraging period. In the deleveraging process, people cut spending, income declines, credit disappears. Asset prices fall, bank runs occur, stock market falls, social tension increases. The whole process starts sliding and forms a vicious cycle. As income falls and repayment costs increase, borrowers feel strapped. As credit disappears, credit dries up, borrowers can no longer borrow enough money to repay debt. Borrowers try to fill this hole, have to sell assets. While spending falls, selling frenzy floods the market with assets for sale. Now, stock market crashes, real estate market collapses, banks get in trouble. As asset prices fall, the value of collateral borrowers can provide decreases, further reducing borrowers' credit. People feel poor, credit quickly disappears.

Spending decreases, income decreases, wealth decreases, credit decreases, borrowing etc. all decrease, this is a vicious cycle. It looks similar to recession, but the difference is, can't save the situation by lowering interest rates. In recession, can stimulate borrowing by lowering interest rates. But, in the deleveraging process, because interest rates are already very low, close to 0, thus losing stimulation function, so lowering interest rates doesn't work. US domestic interest rates dropped to 0 during deleveraging in 1930, and also in 2008. **The difference between recession and deleveraging is, in deleveraging, borrowers' debt burden becomes too heavy, can't be relieved by lowering interest rates**. Lenders realize, debt is too large, simply can't be fully repaid. Borrowers lose repayment ability, their collateral loses value, they feel greatly hurt by debt, don't want to borrow more debt. Lenders stop lending, borrowers stop borrowing, the entire economy like individuals lose creditworthiness.

[](#How-to-Deleverage)How to Deleverage
So how should we deal with deleveraging? The problem is, debt burden too heavy, must be reduced, for this can use four methods.

Individuals, businesses, and government **cut spending**;
**Reduce debt** through debt default and restructuring;
**Redistribute wealth**, transferring wealth from rich to poor;
Central bank **issues more money**.

These four methods are used in every deleveraging process in modern history. Usually the first measure is cutting spending, individuals, businesses, banks, and government all tighten belts to cut spending, thus able to reduce debt. We often call this **austerity**. When borrowers no longer borrow new debt, and start reducing old debt, you would think debt burden would lighten. But the opposite is true! Spending decreased, and one person's spending is another's income, this causes income to decline. Income declines faster than debt repayment speed, so debt burden actually becomes heavier. We've already seen, this spending reduction causes deflation, very painful. Businesses have to cut costs, meaning fewer job opportunities, unemployment rises. This leads to the next step, must reduce debt! Many borrowers can't repay loans. And borrowers' debt is lenders' assets, if borrowers don't repay bank loans, people worry banks can't repay their deposits. So people rush to withdraw deposits from banks, banks experience **runs**, and individuals, businesses, and banks have **debt defaults**. This severe economic contraction is **depression**. **A main feature of depression is, people discover, a large part of the wealth they thought belonged to them actually doesn't exist**.

Let's use the bar example again, when you use credit to buy a beer, you're promising to repay the bar's credit later, your promise becomes an asset of the bar. But, if you don't keep the promise, don't repay the bar's credit, it's actually debt default. Then the bar's "asset" is actually worthless, it actually disappeared. Many lenders don't want their assets to disappear, agree to debt restructuring. Debt restructuring means lenders get less repayment, or repayment period extended, or interest rate lower than the level originally agreed. Either way, the contract is broken, result is debt reduction. Lenders hope to recover some of the loan, better than losing everything. Debt restructuring makes debt disappear, but because it causes income and asset values to disappear faster, debt burden continues to become more serious. Cutting debt like cutting spending is painful and causes deflation. All these affect the central government, because **lower income and fewer jobs mean government tax revenue decreases**. At the same time, because unemployment rises, the central government needs to increase spending, many unemployed have insufficient savings, need government financial assistance. In addition, government formulates stimulus plans and increases spending to make up for reduced economic activity. In the deleveraging process, government's budget deficit soars, because government spending exceeds tax revenue, the budget deficit heard in news is exactly this situation.

Government must raise taxes or borrow to fill the deficit. But, when income falls and many people are unemployed, who should they borrow from? The rich. Because government needs more money, and large wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few rich people. Government naturally increases taxation of the rich to help wealth redistribution in the economy. Transferring wealth from the rich to the poor, the poor in distress start resenting the rich, the rich suffering economic weakness, asset devaluation, and increased tax pressure start resenting the poor. If depression continues, social unrest will erupt. Not only intensified tension within countries, but also between countries, especially between debtor nations and creditor nations. This situation can lead to political change, sometimes extreme change.

In the 1930s, this situation led to Hitler coming to power, war breaking out in Europe, and America's Great Depression. Pressure to take action to end depression kept increasing. Don't forget, the money in people's minds is actually mostly credit. Therefore, once credit disappears, people don't have enough money to spend. People urgently need money, and you must remember, who can issue money, the central bank can. The central bank has already lowered interest rates to near 0, now has to issue more money. **Issuing money is different from cutting spending, reducing debt, and redistributing wealth, it causes inflation and stimulates the economy**. The central bank inevitably issues more money out of thin air, and uses this money to buy financial assets and government bonds. This happened during America's Great Depression, and erupted again in 2008, when America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, increased issuance by over two trillion dollars, other central banks around the world that could do this also issued a lot of money. The central bank by buying financial assets with this money, helped push up asset prices, thus improving people's credit. But, this only helps those who own financial assets, you see the central bank can issue money, but can only buy financial assets.

On the other hand, the central government can buy goods and services, can give money to people, but can't print money. Therefore to **stimulate the economy**, the central bank and government must cooperate. The central bank by buying government bonds, is essentially lending money to the government, enabling it to run **deficit budgets**. And increase spending on buying goods and services through stimulus plans and unemployment relief, this increases people's income, also increases government debt. But this method will reduce the total debt burden in the economy, this is a very risky moment. Policymakers need to balance and consider the four methods of reducing debt burden. Must balance between deflationary methods and inflationary methods to maintain stability. If appropriate balance is achieved, can bring **harmonious deleveraging**. So deleveraging can be painful, or can be harmonious. How to achieve harmonious deleveraging? Although deleveraging is difficult, handling difficult situations with the best possible method is a good thing. Much better than the leverage phase of massive borrowing causing excessive imbalance. In harmonious deleveraging, debt-to-income ratio declines, the economy actually grows positively. At the same time inflation isn't a problem, this is achieved through appropriate balance. To achieve stable balance, need to combine cutting spending, reducing debt, transferring wealth, and issuing money to maintain economic and social stability.

Someone asks, will issuing money exacerbate inflation? **If the additional money issued offsets the decline in loans, it won't cause inflation**. Don't forget, what matters is spending. Every dollar of spending, whether spent as money or credit, has the same effect on prices. The central bank can make up for disappeared credit by increasing money issuance. The central bank to reverse the situation, not only needs to promote income growth, but also needs income growth rate to exceed the interest rate of accumulated debt, what does this mean? Main meaning is, **income must grow faster than debt**.

For example, suppose we have a country experiencing deleveraging, its debt-to-income ratio is 100%, meaning, debt amount equals the entire country's one year income. Suppose these debts have a 2% interest rate, if debt grows at 2% rate while income growth rate is only about 1%, then debt burden will never be reduced, must issue more money, make income growth rate exceed interest rate. However, issuing money is too easy, and this method is more popular than other methods. Therefore this method can be easily abused. The key is to avoid issuing too much money like Germany in the 1920s deleveraging, thus causing hyperinflation.
If policymakers achieve appropriate balance, the deleveraging process won't be so intense, economic growth speed is slow, but debt burden will decline, this is harmonious deleveraging.

When income rises, borrowers' creditworthiness improves. Once borrowers appear more creditworthy, lenders will start resuming lending. Debt burden finally starts to decline, people can borrow money, can increase consumption. The economy finally starts to recover growth, the long-term debt cycle thus enters the reflation phase. If deleveraging is handled improperly, it can be very scary; if handled properly, will eventually solve the problem. To make debt burden decline and economic activity return to normal, takes about ten years or more, therefore there's the saying "**lost decade**".
To sum up, the economy is of course somewhat more complex than this model. However, combining short-term debt cycle, long-term debt cycle, and productivity growth trajectory for analysis, we get a decent model that can see our past and current situation as well as possible future development direction.

[](#Summary)Summary
Finally, hope to learn three principles:

First, don't let debt growth speed exceed income, because debt burden will eventually crush you.
Second, don't let income growth speed exceed productivity, because this will eventually make you lose competitiveness.
Third, do everything possible to improve productivity, because productivity plays the most critical role in the long term.
Learned.
