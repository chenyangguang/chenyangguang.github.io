A Harvard study shows: there are mainly nine root causes for a person being unsuccessful.

"Fearing mistakes is destroying progress." Acting decisively can easily lead to errors, but staying in place and doing nothing is even worse.

[](#Procrastination)Procrastination
Laziness and procrastination can stifle a promising plan to death. Delaying the start or making excuses when encountering problems easily magnifies the difficulties before you, making you shrink back. Excuses can't solve problems at all. Once a negative mindset spreads, it's like dandelion seeds scattered everywhere. And if you step into the quagmire of procrastination, you'll only sink deeper, unable to extricate yourself. As time passes, the heart gradually produces heavy guilt and self-denial.

[](#Three-Minute-Passion)Three-Minute Passion
I feel this too deeply: starting with ambitious plans, only to end in disappointment. Too wide-ranging interests, mostly just skimming the surface. So much so that at critical moments, there are times when I give up halfway. When making those momentary decisions, I didn't even seriously consider the consequences clearly, some I wasn't even aware of. Looking back afterwards, I realized I missed a lot. Only by persisting can you endure the boredom and welcome success, experiencing the joy of harvest.

[](#Fear-of-Rejection)Fear of Rejection
Afraid of rejection, with a heavy yet fragile self-esteem, feeling inexplicable pain in interpersonal relationships. You should still put down your self-esteem to do things, focusing on the direction of results. Pay less attention to others' attitudes toward what you do.

[](#Self-Limitation)Self-Limitation
This psychological hint behavior that kills one's own abilities - I estimate many people have it.

[](#Escaping-Reality)Escaping Reality
Why do I feel like this is talking about me again? When I was young, I often daydreamed, dreaming I could fly, that three-pointers could be 100% accurate... hiding in my own small building without wind or rain.
 liking a life of following one's heart, free and unfettered. In college, all I thought about was playing. Every winter and summer break, I'd go out traveling - my footprints covered all corners of the country. When chatting with friends, I thought others were praising me when they mentioned this issue. Little did I know, these are all manifestations of escaping reality. Close friends won't point it out: you idle fellow!
Addicted to games and fantasy novels. Actually, I'm thinking, those who like movies and TV shows - aren't they also escaping reality! And I occupied every single one of these before.
People with these behaviors of escaping reality think they're living a comfortable and happy life, but in fact it causes irritability and unease that's incompatible with daily life.

[](#Always-Finding-Excuses)Always Finding Excuses
Finding excuses is probably the easiest thing on this planet after survival? People who habitually find excuses are basically those without strong career ambition and persistent pursuit. When something goes wrong, they often第一时间 disassociate themselves completely, thinking it's not their attitude. Whether for self-protection or to clear responsibility, such people always exist in society. Very difficult to work with. When a bug appears, instead of solving it immediately in the first place, they think about fiercely pursuing accountability and blaming others' behavior - this self-comforting behavior is truly detestable. Who doesn't make mistakes? When encountering difficulties and problems, you must step up and solve them. When facing risks, you need to challenge them. Don't retreat!

[](#Fear)Fear
Living cautiously, afraid of this and that. Maybe this has some relationship with age and experience. Before, I feared nothing, neither heaven nor earth. After graduating from college, or maybe after starting college, all kinds of fears came one after another. As if attached to one's body like bacteria. Afraid of criticism, afraid of failure, afraid of results, caring about others' evaluations and attitudes, afraid of one's own shortcomings, afraid of becoming incompetent. Think about it, how fragile is this mindset?

[](#Refusing-to-Learn)Refusing to Learn
In the internet field, with the current development speed, if you don't learn for six months, it feels like you've been disconnected from this world for more than half a century.

[](#Summary)Summary
Go all out to learn, to experience, to live, to pursue. Every day is so special, every day is so precious. How many people don't have our current conditions, yet can still do so many meaningful things for family, for society, for the public? Besides...
