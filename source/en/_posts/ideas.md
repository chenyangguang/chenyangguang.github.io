Today re-watching Go videos, still found, current game record still relies on manual input methods.
Interestingly, in 2015 when professional young player Zhao Chenyu fought a Korean player, both disputed not finding a ko threat and directly captured the ko. Major tournaments usually are equipped with recorders. But from last year until now, professional players have reflected that when explaining games, some game records likely have wrong move order. After all, professional games take several hours. Recorders can't concentrate as much time and energy on each move like professional players. This process has possibility of wrong order. But Go extremely values order, even just one or two moves order, creates various wonderful flavors.
Then, when Go players play they also need to manually press the timer. Some players sometimes so focused on playing, actually forget to press the clock, finally lose the precious competition because of this! Too ironic! This attention-distracting clock-pressing way shouldn't be given to the player currently playing.
So should design and implement an intelligent chessboard that automatically and accurately records game records, will greatly liberate game recorders' work, restore competition fairness, and provide players with the most focused attention during competition.

Smart chessboard features:

Automatic game recording
Provide video replay
Intelligent time recording
Countdown voice
