Past half year, experienced quite a few new things.
Encountered quite a few problems. But all passed, all passed one by one.
Problems encountered in work this half year, more than last year combined. Mainly because of job change, originally working on php and python development转到 golang above. Then work environment from ubuntu切到 windows. Who says development tools aren't important, when really in a team, surrounding toolchain really affects efficiency.

[](#No-Title)No Title
和 golang相匹配的工具链一大坨, docker, elk, beego, k8s all need time to digest, then also need to补课 on basics (data structures and algorithms still weak), understanding of network protocols still shallow, familiarity with mysql, redis not deep enough yet. These are just spare time matters. Daily work often involves various bugs left by old systems, investigating logs, locating problems, operation and maintenance fixes. While also dealing with other departments, communicating painful requirements, "cross-examination"...

[](#Small-Achievement)Small Achievement
But this half year was quite fulfilling. Handled more problems, slowly getting some sense of things. Have some division of priorities for certain things, gradually finding time to implement things considered more valuable.
And each hurdle crossed, confidence increased a bit more. Later encountering problems, won't be so panicked.

Strong people need to face more difficulties.
