description: 'Story Plot "Ball Lightning" is one of Liu Cixin's early science fiction works. Told in the first person, it's a sci-fi story about a teenager who, after losing his parents to ball lightning during a violent stormy night in childhood, becomes fascinated with ball lightning. Reading Experience 1 After graduating from college, I haven't read sci-fi novels for a long time. Reading novels now is very different from before - mainly quick browsing. No longer carefully chewing over every detail like before. Also, chapters I'm not interested in are often skipped directly. Additionally, I get suddenly brought into the real world by certain scenes in the middle - this should be "distraction." Not that kind of purely imaginative scenario. This might be the feeling that imagination gradually weakens as you see and touch more reality-based things. At one point, I even found some scene descriptions suspicious, thinking those things couldn't happen.'

But isn't the true goal of science fiction to connect with reality and transcend it, to think about and envision those beautiful unknown things? These imaginations create creations and events that didn't exist in the past or present but might exist in the future. For example, the "thousand-mile eye" and "wind-following ear" in ancient Chinese mythology like "Investiture of the Gods" now have practical counterparts. But what truly fascinates us is always the unknown - like black holes, interstellar travel. Whether macroscopic or microscopic imagination, it's all the beauty of this universe.

I was particularly touched by one sentence: "The key to a wonderful life is what you can become fascinated with." Isn't this what we pursue and strive for throughout our lives?
