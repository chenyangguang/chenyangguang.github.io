[](#Double-Eleven-Whatever)Double Eleven Whatever
Seems unrelated to me, this day spent 50 yuan, weekend, eating plus fruit. Want to buy Bose QC 35, needs 2000+, AirPods also needs at least 1200+, forget it for now. Not time yet.

[](#Reason-for-Blog)Reason for Blog
Rather than reason for blogging, it's a way to organize my thoughts. Not for anyone to read, whoever doesn't read. Let my thoughts spread out, write wherever I think, no need like childhood Chinese composition class, no need like college entrance exam proof, no need like university graduation design. Anyway, whatever I think now, I write. No need to care about likes, even less about what shares.

[](#Recent-Exercise-Focus)Recent Exercise Focus
Since ankle skin injury not fully healed, recently adjusted exercise focus ratio, increased plank support. Body's center is in waist and abdomen, so need to strengthen body's core position. Plank exercises body's core muscle groups, after a while of morning and evening exercise, currently single session can support 90s. Twice daily, three sets each, totaling about 12 minutes a day.

[](#No-Fear-of-Wild-Fox-3-Dan)No Fear of Wild Fox 3 Dan
A year ago, I was still wild fox 1 dan level. Since September starting, against wild fox 2 dan I already have over 70% win rate. October even reached 4 dan, but very unstable, from 2 dan up, consecutive wins for a while, consecutive losses for a while, back and forth, very unstable, so still 3 dan level. Later analyzed, very little replay. Currently Tencent Go's Jueyi replay is open to public. Play two games a day, can earn 4 points, 5 points can apply for one Jueyi replay, checked my win rate distribution, found most wins are my comebacks. Since entering November, against 3 dan, already have 60% win rate. But I insist on at most two quality games a day. Hope to spend more time discovering my weak points, like opening, close combat. Hope to improve Go strength to stable 4 dan medium-upper level by year end.

[](#Walking)Walking
Personally, I feel most inspired when on the road. While walking, let thoughts spread, drift. Let them wander, rotate, reassemble, combine, various troubles and annoyances from workdays slowly evaporate with distance, gradually dilute with elevation, fade with time. I like walking, so far, several major life choices were made while looking far ahead while walking.
Among Five Mountains, haven't been to West Mount Hua, North Mount Heng, Middle Mount Song. Before year end find time to go, look. A colleague asks, you like climbing mountains so much, but after climbing back no change. Indeed, climbing a mountain may really not change anything. But I can go out and see other places' real existence, broaden my horizons. Suddenly thought of someone who reached Mount Everest summit saying: "because the mountain is there." "What can this learn from, climbing mountains can learn?" I was speechless. Like reading a book, very likely after reading, feel no gain, then next time will I still read? Yes. Why? Because whether you feel it or not, things I've experienced will have invisible effect on my cognition, worldview, life philosophy. Can't predict which moment, you'll think of a blooming blue lotus flower once seen, can't predict which moment, a wild grass in mountain stone cracks will appear, can't predict some late quiet night, sketching camping's starry sky. They've buried in my memory, rooted in my blood. They tell me, time passes, life is resilient, starry sky is vast. And I've seen a moment of flowers, my hand touched flowing clouds on mountain top, I welcomed high-altitude sunrise and sunset. This is what I've truly lived for half a year since closing朋友圈, thinking about.
