[](#2017-Summary)2017 Summary
Originally wanted to do a summary the day before New Year, later because of job change, plus adapting to new environment, dragged on for a while.

[](#Time-Spending)Time Spending
In 2017, utilization of work time improved, especially for half the year basically focused in the morning, concentrating on completing the day's main coding tasks. From first half of year's habit of prioritizing zhihu and News at work had some changes. So less overtime, more time to research things I'm interested in, also laid foundation for current work.

But, utilization of commuting time and weekends wasn't sufficient. Especially since can reach outside the wall, often watched Youtube videos, quite a few movies, TV series, courses, music, and个别 variety shows. Whole 2017, English listening and reading improved some, spoken language 0 improvement.

Org-mode work logs in Emacs basically only saw work time distribution, very rough. Occasional task priorities not yet archived.

Question

Actually quite a few problems, like:
Good planning, insufficient execution,
Professional dedication focus and stamina lacking,
Slacking or attention diverted by other things.
Often have ideas, especially in the car, occasionally new concepts or ideas, or sparks to change life status, but moment of decision not decisive enough! Even a bit of dragging! Many times, thoughts and actions inconsistent! Knowing and doing not one! Like an army without unified will, so this year's result, only "hehe" two words. This problem, in short time, still needs gradual approach. Otherwise, 2018, still be constrained.

[](#About-Early-Rising)About Early Rising
In 2017, except during cold, Chinese New Year, and friend gatherings drinking a bit, next day would get up a bit later. These together about 10 days getting up later than 8:30, about 340 days basically getting up between 5:50-7:30, finally formed a habit! Can continue, early rising guarantees day's energy!

[](#Goals)Goals
Temporarily keep in Org-mode. Leave some suspense, summarize again at 2019 New Year. But, 2018's primary goal is to pay off technical debt owed in 2017.
