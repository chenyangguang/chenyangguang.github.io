Last Saturday 2018-08-25, afraid of missing the car in the middle of the night, set alarms for 3:00, 3:30, 4:00. Fortunately got up in time with the first alarm. Arrived at airport by 4:20.

In this city for four years, first time to this airport. Initially thought I had plenty of time. But just curiously watched people coming and going here, quietly sighed about the airport dome, walked from security to boarding gate, felt like bypassing two playgrounds.
6:10 AM flight.
First time on a plane. That feeling, really cool. Especially while nervous and extremely excited sitting on the plane, rumbling on the runway, grass behind moving back faster and faster, running running, back leaned against, front lifted up, feet felt a thick board pushing, flew up! Going to sky!

Mount Tai and Big Dipper, isn't it harder to climb than Hengshan! Eighteen bends... give me a few more plates.

Set up a small tent at mountain top, rent a military coat. Thought could sleep until at least 4 AM on stone ground...谁知 after 1 AM, tents around gradually got busy, couldn't sleep at all. Gaming, chatting, playing, eating, shouting cold, humming tunes, kids crying... Many people watching sunrise traveled thousands of miles to arrive for this good day. Got up at 4, wanted to find a spot, all stone surfaces that could stand people nearby were occupied... Later crawled through bushes to a slightly dangerous high platform with fewer people. Occupied it.
Around 5:30, came out!
At sunrise, the sea of clouds light and shadow on the horizon and the newborn disc, truly unstoppable, that penetrating light flexible yet solid. People on three mountain tops couldn't help shouting together. Various phone poses raised, leaving extraordinary golden reflections on Mount Tai.

That Lao She's house is so closed! "Jinan's Winter" was written in such a yard? Really miss that era people's feelings toward heaven, earth, and people.
