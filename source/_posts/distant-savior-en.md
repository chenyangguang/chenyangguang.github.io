Perspective on society has three levels in sequence: technology, system, and culture. From a single person to a nation or people, any fate is ultimately the product of that cultural attribute. Strong culture creates strong people, weak culture creates weak people. This is the law, also can be understood as the Heavenly Way, independent of human will.
Strong culture is culture that follows the laws of things, weak culture is culture that relies on the strong's moral expectations to break rules and obtain, it's culture that expects a savior. In martial arts, strong culture is called "secret manual," while weak culture, because it's easy to learn, understand, and use, has become a popular variety.
For example, in the cultural industry, literature and film are arts that pry into souls. If literary and film creation can crack the cultural codes of higher thinking spaces, then its function is to enlighten people's consciousness, shock people's souls. This is what all beings need, it's merit, market, fame and fortune. The huge profits of spiritual salvation are completely equivalent to the huge profits of drug anesthesia, and without the trickery of drug dealing, no psychological cost or legal risk.
Without a Master, where do doctrines and ideas come from? The Master is everywhere. Simply put, that thing that支配人的价值取舍行为 is the Master, is the cultural attribute.
Civilization is powerless against those who can't be defined by the word "human."
Treat a dead horse as a live horse. At worst, can a dead horse die again?
The huge profits of stocks don't come from production and operation, but from the投机性 of the stock market itself. Its driving force is: putting money from your pocket into mine. Its rule is: filling the mouths of a very small number of wolves with the meat of most sheep.
The operation of the legal machine doesn't take confession as a condition. Law requires ultimate rigor in procedure and content.
The logic of robbers: direct acquisition, adventure, stimulation.
The essence of robbers is breaking rules to obtain. "Breaking rules to obtain" and "direct acquisition" are two different concepts. You have no confidence to compete fairly with strong people under the same rules. This only shows you're weak, because the highest value pursued by weak culture is breaking rules to obtain. So, the logic of robbers is essentially the most cowardly survival philosophy.
Saving souls is the Bible's business.
The Bible's reasoning is: those who believe are saved and go to heaven; those who don't believe have sin and go to hell. Using this method of coaxing children and scaring men to make people believe, while beneficial to Christian practice, also caters to people's fear of death and greed. This kind of cause and effect no longer gives people the opportunity for self-awareness and self-reflection. People don't even have the opportunity to pursue nobility, so how can they be noble?
What is God? God is created according to human needs. (Allow me to imitate: What are ghosts? Ghosts are created according to human fears.)
Bible theology is the theory of human spirit, the theory of soul purification and sublimation, the theory of noble and orthodox human behavior. Blindly attacking or defending the truth of God is ignorant. The former doesn't understand Christianity's historical and social value, the latter doesn't understand Christianity's true realm.
What is God? God is the Way, the Way follows nature, Tathagata.
You don't know you, so you are you. If you know you, you're no longer you.
There were no myths in this world to begin with. So-called myths are just ordinary things that ordinary people's thinking can't easily understand.
No matter what you do, the market is not an infinitely large cake. The essence of myth is strong force killing the rich to help the poor. This can produce two problems: first, is killing the rich destructive exploitation of market resources? Second, is letting people at the bottom of the well climb up to look at the well rim then fall back making them mentally terminally ill?
Buddhists often say the word "证到" (realize/enlighten), but never tell you what comes after "证到", because wanting to say and explain can't, because conditions' conditions, causes' causes' causes, so it's like drinking water, knowing if it's cold or warm yourself.
This is rounding the world, not showing mountains or revealing water, each in its proper place. But character, today missing a corner, tomorrow cracking a seam, is not far from collapse.
Society's goodwill toward a company is also part of commercial benefits. This isn't a moral realm issue, it's a market survival law issue. This goodwill is not just us强行摊派 values, not just corroding our own competitiveness, but shows we're not conquering the market with products but mixing in the market with showmanship. This humanistic evaluation that violates commercial attributes will eventually bury this company.
Survival law is very simple: endure what others can't endure, do what others can't do. Endurance is a line, ability is a line, the gap between them is survival opportunity. If we endure what others don't and do what others can't, we have more survival opportunities than others. Market survival competition is very cruel, victory or defeat is often in the finest margins. When both hurt, if you have one more breath than him, you're the winner. (Secretly corresponds to Go's dragon-slaying mutual kill)
Capitalize on strengths, avoid weaknesses, fill gaps, learn to survive in cracks.
Companies must resist market risks by continuously developing markets and improving services.
Open history and look, from which industry and which page can you find records of saviors saving the world? None, never, always the savior being saved, the saved saving others. If you must speak of a savior, then the culture that conforms to and represents objective laws is the savior.
The essence of poverty alleviation is in the word "help." If you never plan to stand up yourself, even God coming is useless.
Law has no fixed law, existence determines consciousness.

"Enlightenment"

Enlightened way, don't speak of fate,
Cultivation, don't seek true scriptures.
One joy one sorrow one wither one glory,
Which was predetermined in past life?

Kasaya has no purity,
Red dust doesn't stain empty nature.
Deep ancient temple thousand-year bell,
All are madmen talking dreams.

So-called true scriptures are the ultimate method that can reach nirvana. Can be enlightened but not cultivated. Cultivation to become Buddha is in seeking. Enlightenment is understanding nature, in knowing. Cultivation uses conduct to control nature, enlightenment uses nature to implement conduct. The awakened generate discipline from the heart, the cultivator use discipline to control the heart. Those who don't fall into bad consequences have faith but no realization, dwelling in cause dwelling in effect, dwelling in thought dwelling in mind, thus birth and death. Those who don't delude cause and effect dwell without dwelling, no desire no non-desire, no precept no non-precept, thus nirvana.

Buddha is awakened nature, not human. Everyone has awakened nature doesn't mean awakened nature is human. Human form can be destroyed, awakened nature has no birth no death, immediately enlightened immediately revealed, immediately obstructed then dust obscures, no obstruction not revealed, ending obstruction nirvana. The Buddha of complete enlightenment and practice is the Buddha of Buddhism's human image. Complete means stop, not infinite. If Buddha has quantity, it's not Amitabha. Buddha Dharma is infinite, meaning awakened conduct is infinite, no complete no incomplete, no full no not full, also no name called ultimate complete. Buddhism is divided by levels, from the profound perspective it's the Tao of achieving heaven naturally, Tao follows Tathagata unthinkable, not culture. From the shallow perspective it's the doctrine of guiding people toward good. Good and evil originally have human form, self form, sentient being form, that is culture. From the sentient being perspective it's the skillful means of using greed to control greed, using illusion to control illusion. Although it doesn't eliminate corruption and degeneration, it doesn't hinder the compassion of soothing souls.
Sit, please sit, please take the upper seat. Tea, serve tea, serve good tea.
Throw stone hit water, no splash but ripples. Wonderful in using poverty alleviation as the proposition. When knowledgeable people scold you as worse than robbers, the scolder, scolding is diagnosing. Diagnosing without treating is no different from concluding as terminal illness, not what benevolent people do, and can't bear this greater infamy. Therefore, scolding must discuss the Way.
The dead knot of traditional concepts is in the word "rely" - at home rely on parents, going out rely on friends, rely on God, rely on Bodhisattva, rely on imperial grace...总之 rely on anything is fine, just don't rely on yourself. This is a cultural attribute issue that has settled for thousands of years, not a few new culture movements can enlighten.
Great love doesn't love
The way of weak people being saved, exists and doesn't exist. A society without competition has no vitality, but competition inevitably produces wealth and poverty, class, this is the Heavenly Way, the inevitable price of social progress. No weak, where is strong? In the word "strong," "weak" is already in it. Therefore, Buddha saves heart suffering, cultivating is an ordinary heart.
Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism are the three major systems of Chinese traditional culture. Traditional culture after all takes imperial grace as a prerequisite, all about "empty," "non-action," "middle way," suppressing individuality to seek survival and understanding.
Without hell, where is heaven? Someone has to stay in hell. Let's count as one, otherwise heaven has no place to land.
The Way of heaven discussed to the extreme, common people's firewood, rice, oil, salt. Life's cold and warm discussed to the extreme, men and women's one word "love."
Buddha says "seeing mountain is mountain, seeing water is water." I just according to Buddhism truthfully observe, seeing modern girl is modern girl, seeing confidante is confidante.
Inside the rail is pure, outside the rail is earth. Leaning on the rail you can smoke.
Have people, have guns, have territory, still worry about no designation?
Camel through needle's heaven (? don't understand)
Do you believe in God? "Ending delusion only truth" is God (Ending delusion only truth?) Ending delusion only truth, what is the relationship between God and human? Not one not different
Travel is intent, broadening horizons, increasing knowledge is intent.
Thought of then do, take what should take, release what should release, self-nature acts not deluding cause and effect.
From phenomenon participating to system, participating to culture, because any fate, ultimately is the product of that culture.
Measuring a cultural attribute doesn't look at how long it settled, but at how close it is to objective laws. Five thousand years of culture is glory, is brilliance, this no problem. But, tradition and customs must pass the sieve of objective laws.
Having culture and having what culture are not the same concept.
Not acting when shouldn't act is acting. Being able to live clearly is good enough.
The charm of good sound itself is sufficient, no need for unnecessary decoration and embellishment.
If my ability can only make me poor and destitute, then poor and destitute is my value.
Everyone's position, perspective, mindset, and thinking mode are different. The amount of information obtained and the way of interpreting information are also different.
"Good to listen" is art, only everyone's "good to listen" standard is different.
Being able to "seek truth from facts" is myth. Those who can speak honest truth, do honest things are gods.
God is the Way, the Way is laws, laws like Tathagata, tolerate no speculation, those who follow laws are what.
People fundamentally only face two problems: first, survival, must live; second, must answer the question of life's value, let the heart have a place to dwell.
5 years later I won't mind you being old, can you just not be old? 5 years later I become a pervert, worth you looking back?
Not making a living by job application. Degree not very meaningful, should learn what's useful.
Whether culture art or survival art, have Way no Art, Art can be sought. Have Art no Way, stop at Art.
Aim high, dig deep.
Foreign countries aren't our kitchen, not enter whenever I want. Rich men aren't eggs in the vegetable market, not grab one whenever I want.
Matthew effect: You have, give you more; you don't have, take away what you originally have.
When people once jump out of danger, they no longer pay attention to this thing's danger, their eyes all fall on this thing's benefits, this is human nature.
