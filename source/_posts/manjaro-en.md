After installing manjaro, the primary task is to connect to wifi. Unlike arch Linux's

```ebnf
wifi-menu
```

command, the manjaro version wifi connection command is

```ebnf
nmtui
```

Haha, the interface that comes out is blue screen, similar to XP crash interface, hahaha.

But overall, manjaro's general desktop version is quite clean and tidy. Of course, the most attractive thing is like arch, the numerous software in the repository. Besides pacman for managing software, there's also yaourt, though recently yaourt isn't maintained much, need to switch to yay.

Anyway, Dragon Boat Festival, also gaokao season, network speed is very slow.

On my SSD with deepin installed, I allocated half the space to manjaro. There's also a mechanical hard drive 445G also a manjaro.
