Watching source code, produces a doubt: why am I reading source code? Originally when I went to the底层 to read source code, purely curious, wanted to know the mechanism behind its operation. But, recently started getting tired. Suddenly thought: is this unnecessary? Because, a good race car driver, may not be able to build cars or repair cars. But he can drive the car very smoothly, showing speed and passion! And a car builder or repairman, may not be able to show off on the F1 track. So, after satisfying curiosity, is there still need to deeply investigate the underlying implementation logic?
