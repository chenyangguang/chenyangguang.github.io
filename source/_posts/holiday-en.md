description: 'Macau Half Day (2018-06-16) Usually locked in an office like a cage, today read books for half a day, feeling bored. While rummaging through boxes, found the Hong Kong and Macau pass still had entries. So bought a 14:30 ferry ticket, departing from Shekou, heading to Macau. The target is the observation tower. Several interesting things happened on the way. Let me record them. First, the strange fellow passenger. Originally my ferry ticket was second row window seat on the second floor, result was an old man in a thick coat arrived first, sat in my seat. When I went up and signaled he sat in my cabin seat, he said he wanted to sit by the porthole, wanted to swap with me. Thinking of caring for the elderly, forget it. Originally I also wanted to sit outside for easier sea view. Later he kept using his phone to look at information. Until I took out "Blockchain Principles, Design and Applications" to read for a while. He took advantage of me turning pages, wanted to borrow the book to see the cover and table of contents, flipped through it casually. Then his eyes lit up, said: "Can I borrow this book for a minute to take a photo"? I was a bit stunned, but immediately came back: "Sure, if you want to read, take it and read. No problem, I can continue reading when I go back". He quickly explained: "Oh, no need, I want to borrow it to take a few photos". "Sure, sure. Here." I saw his eyes like spotting prey. Holding this book, quickly flipping, took a few photos. Then pressed a voice button, started voice messaging to his phone: "Secretary Zhang, I just sent you photos of a book, go place an order, ... Also, investigate whether there are similar books, order a few sets... Order 10 sets first, let those below xxx level study and learn first. Alright..." Some other words I couldn't remember clearly. Anyway, could tell, the guy by my porthole was no ordinary tourist! And, based just on a book a tourist on the ship was reading, how could he immediately call someone to place an order? This puzzled me greatly. Shows this person has some instinct for cutting-edge technology or the market. This surprised me a bit.'

Usually locked in an office like a cage, today read books for half a day, feeling bored. While rummaging through boxes, found the Hong Kong and Macau pass still had entries. So bought a 14:30 ferry ticket, departing from Shekou, heading to Macau. The target is the observation tower. Several interesting things happened on the way. Let me record them.

When I went up and signaled he sat in my cabin seat, he said he wanted to sit by the porthole, wanted to swap with me. Thinking of caring for the elderly, forget it.

[](#Second,-233-Meter-High-Walk.)Second, 233 Meter High Walk.
Was looking forward to this trip having some psychological breakthrough. 233 meters, I was going for that bungee jump. When the car crossed the coast on the bridge, I saw this observation tower from afar. The tower body is multi-shaped, below the tower tip is a circular observation deck. One side has two stay cables diagonally. Took the elevator up, through the glass door, saw the ground gradually sinking, heart started beating. At the 58th floor, leaning on the glass window, standing on those transparent boards, watching the cars on the west side so small, people so small. Afraid I'd fall down. Bungee jumpers, from above with arms spread, making a cross, shouting forward falling down, the 58th floor crowd gathered, all sticking their heads out to watch. Haha, my heart thought: these people...

61st floor. This is where various activities enter. Took a price list. So expensive! That bungee jump costs over 4000澳元! Only the space walk is three digits. 780澳元. (If you don't exchange when going out, at scenic spots it's uniformly 1:1 exchange rate, slight loss)
Limited budget, finally only played the space walk. Sunset, 233 meters high stepping over the edge looking down, still a bit afraid. After looking a few times, did some moves. Just sat on the edge looking down. Took a few deep breaths. Finally not afraid. Hahaha. Quite interesting!
There was a插曲, when storing things in the locker, found could only use 30港元, had to go exchange. Just finished exchanging, then a pretty-looking girl didn't bring cash, was trying to communicate with those issuing tickets, saying ticket was bought, but no cash couldn't open locker to store bag. The ticket issuer suggested borrowing from me, then transfer to me. I said we could just use one box together. My phone battery was about to die, borrowed a charger from her. Then she went bungee jumping! Really knows how to play. So daring!
After the high-altitude walk, sat up there and read ten more pages of "Blockchain Principles, Design and Applications". When she finished jumping and came back, glanced at her, very calm. At that moment, felt that girl was so beautiful. Then, returned the locker items to her. Thanked each other, each went on their way. Because it was overtime, she wanted to transfer, I said treat as charger fee. Then, no then.

[](#Zhuhai-Ocean-Kingdom-One-Day-2018-06-17)Zhuhai Ocean Kingdom One Day (2018-06-17)
Resting in Zhuhai, went early in the morning to Shenzhen's two largest parks. Felt Zhuhai is a livable city not suitable for tourism. Don't know if it's holiday or population is small, felt the pressure here should be much less than Shenzhen. Pedestrians walk so leisurely.
Took bus toward the southern end of Zhuhai. That's Chimelong.
Rode Shenzhen's wooden roller coaster, this roller coaster, didn't feel much throughout. Even weightlessness wasn't that strong. Maybe related to yesterday's Macau high-altitude walk.
Dolphin and beluga whale performances, make one sigh, animals are amazing.
Various animals only in underwater ecosystems, saw here. Most shocking was still jellyfish. Magical animals chasing light.
I was thinking, how can their halls be so big, how are those ecosystems maintained? So many underwater animals inside, how to maintain balance? How to feed all animals? Water circulation is done very well. Water quality is very clean.
Then, today also met the girl who shared a locker with me yesterday. She and her boyfriend also came here to play. Too coincidental.

[](#Summary)Summary
While traveling, the most important thing is contacting people from different worlds, speaking different languages. Many tourists with fantasy journeys, traveling thousands of miles, gathering together, then scattering.
Then, on the road, the probability of meeting girls is much higher than staying at home.
The world is big, unbelievable things, extraordinary people, many, many.
Go out more often.
Should be like before when going to Tibet, record all thoughts and feelings on the road. Very interesting.
